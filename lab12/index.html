		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab was difficult. Lots of trial and error. But with my notes and w3 school I was able to make it work.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Problems I had were certain numbers not outputing which varied as I built my code. The numbers that are not divisible by anything were the ones not ouputing. I added a new 'if' statement to fix that. Which was in my notes but it took me a while to figure out what it does.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see the results bellow.</p>
