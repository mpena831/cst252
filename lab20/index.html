		<h1>Lab 20: JSON APIs (XKCD Comic!)</h1>
	<div class="text">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This was an interesting lab. I thought it would be more simple since it's similar to the last lab but I did have one major issue that had me searching through google for a solution.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The problem I had was that my comic was not outputting. The issue was shown on the console, basically a "CORS error". So I found an article online where it showed one solution and it was to send the url to a proxy server where it applies the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. Whatever that means. It was simple enough to apply to my code and it made my lab work!</p>
