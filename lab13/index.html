		<h1>Lab 13: Debugging</h1>
	<div class="text">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab was a good way to go back to past labs and improve them.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I didn't have any broken code. Instead I messed with the debugger to add breakpoints. Also,I made sure all my labs had links to my homepage and java code. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see a screen shot of the results bellow.</p>

			<p>I went back to my lab 12 and I used the debugger to create a breakpoint in my code. It was interesting to experiment with. I learned to press the play button in the console to see how the code executes. </p>
