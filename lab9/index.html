		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab took conciderably more effort to execute. I struggled to output my new text.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The first issue was that my "output" div was not displaying the new elements I created. I was stuck doing that until I went back to the instructions. I found that I just needed to add "defer" in my script link on the head section.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see the results bellow.</p>
