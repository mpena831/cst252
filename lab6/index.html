		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The main challenge was trying to get the document.writeIn() to work again. But taking out the "In" part seems to work for me.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Writing the JavaScript seemed to work better than typing it in the console. While I enjoy seeing how things will output on conosole before progaming it, when it came to using conosle.log() and print the myMainRide object it would print 'My main ride: [object Object]'. When I added the same code on the js file and tested locally, it would output correctly.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see the results bellow. Everything seems to work compared to the screenshots provided in the instructions.</p>
