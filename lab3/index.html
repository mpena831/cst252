		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<div class="text">
		<h3>Subject</h3>
			<p>The goal for this project is to create an file structure on our computer and create a homepage for our labs.</p>
		<h3>Difficulties</h3>
			<p>All of this we are doing is a good refresher. After surviving CST 251, where I was a beginner to HTML and CSS, this helps remember things.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>The end results were good. I'm usually organized so creating a file structure was not a problem. Creating a homepage once again was fun too. I plan on styling it better as the semester goes.</p>
