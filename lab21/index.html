		<h1>Lab 20: Git and Github</h1>
	<div class="text">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This was an interesting lab. Github is very strange to me. But once I got it to work it seems like a useful app to use to share files.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The problem I had was not being able to add a repo this first few times. Instead of uploading the files on my cst252 folder, it kept creating a new/empty cst252 folder. It was frustrating. Until I kept deleting the repo and trying it again and again until it managed to upload the cst252 folder. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see the screenshots bellow.</p>
