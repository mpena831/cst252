		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<section id="challenges">
			<p>This was a challenging lab only because I had trouble making things change. I was able to make the class but nothing would happen.</p>
			<button id="challenge-button">Change!</button>
			</section>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<section id="problems">
			<p>Problems I had was trying to make the text change color. I was positive my JS code was fine. It had to do with my CSS. So it was a lot of trial and error and what I did in CSS was have ".change1 p" rather than have just ".change1" to style my text because nothing would happen before. Then it finally worked.  </p>
