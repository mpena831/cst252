		<h1>Lab 16: Libraries and Intro to jQuery</h1>
	<div class="text">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>This was a challenging lab to work on. Especially because I forgot what we covered in class(I worked on this over the weekend). But looking at my notes and reviewing the lecture helped refresh my mind. After that it was exciting to code with jQuery. It makes coding much easier.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Problems I had actually included creating the button. After spending more than an hour on this, I don't think I did it correctly. So I added a button tag in my HTML, but I was able to add the text inside the button and making the button green all with JS. Doing that alone was cool. I think practicing with this more will make me better at using jQuery. I had no problem adding a label all with JS. At least the button works!</p>
