		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The main challenge was trying to get the document.write() to work.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>So my script was giving no output. All I did was change "document.writeIn()"" to "document.write()"" which seemed to make things work. Also the outputs were not styled so I just made all elements inside my divs "color: white;"</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You can see the restults bellow.</p>
